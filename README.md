# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application is a simple magic 8 ball responder, wherein a user types in their question and is given a simple answer. It incorporates all the usual 8-ball responses, but also throws in some random ones that may surprise you. It requires a login, so that it can store the number of times you received a certain response, and lets you know whether someone else has entered the 8-ball website.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Elevator pitch

Do you feel paralyzed by choice in this increasingly consumer focused world? Do you need an excuse to not work on homework? Do you need to know whether a certain someone likes you? Well, the magic 8 ball waits to answer these pressing questions and bring you completely relevant and truthful advice. 

But wait there's more, this 8 ball isn't just your everyday, run-of-the-mill magic 8 ball, it is more accurately named the COSMIC 8-Ball, on account of it's cosmically large set of answers (including weather reports and random cat facts).
