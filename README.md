# Cosmic 8-Ball

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application is a simple magic 8 ball responder, wherein a user types in their question and is given a simple answer. It incorporates all the usual 8-ball responses, but also throws in some random ones that may surprise you. It requires a login, so that it can store the number of times you received a certain response, and lets you know whether someone else has entered the 8-ball website.

<!-- > [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Do you feel paralyzed by choice in this increasingly consumer focused world? Do you need an excuse to not work on homework? Do you need to know whether a certain someone likes you? Well, the magic 8 ball waits to answer these pressing questions and bring you completely relevant and truthful advice.

But wait there's more, this 8 ball isn't just your everyday, run-of-the-mill magic 8 ball, it is more accurately named the COSMIC 8-Ball, on account of it's cosmically large set of answers (including weather reports and random cat facts).

### Key features

- login and logout capabilities!
- Additional responses than the usual ones!
- Answers your deepest questions! (provided you don't care so much about the quality)
- Lets you know if someone else is logged on as well
- Displays a list of all the answers you've received upon request

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Pages for login and displaying the 8-ball.
- **CSS** - look and feel of the website, color scheme and fomatting for desktop and smartphone viewing.
- **React** - Interaction with buttons and handling changes between web pages.
- **Service** - Retrieves information about the weather, random cat facts and random dog facts.
- **DB/Login** - stores information about the user's questions and answers. Also securely stores user information and verifies login information.
- **WebSocket** - Displays a notification on the side bar whenever another user has joined the COSMIC 8-Ball. Though I might allow players to provide answers to other players if that would be possible?

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Stores data in MongoDB** - I implemented storing user data in MongoDB, so that the user can click on the "your stats" page and see all the questions they've ever asked and all the answers they've received. Maybe someday I will need to implement periodic cleansing of the database. I wonder if simon is as intelligent about that.
- [x] **Stores credentials in MongoDB** - I implemented storing user credentials in MongoDB, so that the user can log in again even if the website is restarted.
