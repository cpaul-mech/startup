## AWS

I managed to create an AWS account, though I'm not sure what any of the vernacular means.
I learned about how to host a webserver, I learned how to ssh! That's quite exciting because that means I can ssh into other applications!! I wonder if I could do it like the guys in my capstone.

Also, this is a super important command! This allows me to ssh into my server and thus edit code there in later deliverables. 
'ssh -i ~/Documents/Chris_Documents/cpaulmechcs260webserver.pem ubuntu@44.199.41.73'
If I did it right, I should be using the free tier of aws, and if something crazy happens they might charge me a little, but it should not be a whole lot of charges.
